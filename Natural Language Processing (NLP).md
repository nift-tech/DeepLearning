# What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The use of algorithms to determine properties of natural, human language so that computers can understand what humans have written or said. NLP includes teaching computer systems how to extract data from bodies of written text, translate from one language to another, and recognize printed or handwritten words. Notably, NLP is the field that allows for our everyday use of virtual assistants such as Siri.



The best known library for NLP is the Natural Language Toolkit, or the NLTK (https://www.nltk.org/).
