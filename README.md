### What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a machine learning technique that constructs artificial neural networks to mimic the structure and function of the human brain. In practice, deep learning, also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning, uses a large number hidden layers -typically more than 6 but often much higher - of nonlinear processing to extract features from data and transform the data into different levels of abstraction (representations).
