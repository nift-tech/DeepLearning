# What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is the field of study surrounding how computers see and understand digital images and videos. Computer vision spans all tasks performed by biological vision systems, including "seeing" or sensing a visual stimulus, understanding what is being seen, and extracting complex information into a form that can be used in other processes. This interdisciplinary field simulates and automates these elements of human vision systems using sensors, computers, and machine learning algorithms. Computer vision is the theory underlying artificial intelligence systems' ability to see and understand their surrounding environment. 

# Applications of Computer Vision

There are many examples of computer vision applied because its theory spans any area where a computer will see its surroundings in some form. Below are examples of computer vision:

##### Autonomous Vehicles 
- Self-driving cars need to gather information about their surroundings to decide how to behave.

##### Facial Recognition
 - Businesses and personal electronics use facial recognition technology to "see" who is trying to gain access to something. It has become a powerful security tool.

##### Image Search and Object Recognition 
- Many applications use data vision theory to identify objects within images, search through catalogues of images, and extract information out of images.
##### Robotics 
- Most robotic machines, often in manufacturing, need to see their surroundings to perform the task at hand. In manufacturing machines may be used to inspect assembly tolerances by "looking at"  them.
